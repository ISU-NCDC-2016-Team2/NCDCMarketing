<h1>Our History</h1>
<h3>Humble Beginnings</h3>
<p>Before NCDC was a big corporation, it was an idea in the mind of our founder,
Alonso Van Amelsvoort. Alonso was the son of a small town plumber and spent a good deal of time learning the trade so that he could take over the family business. He wasn't particularly good at plumbing, however, and came home soaked in waste more than once. Shortly before his 18th birthday, Alonso had a dream of a country dotted with cities that sparkled with the light of a thousand stars and flowed with clean water. The very next day, he packed up his few belongings and headed for the big city.</p>
<br />
<p>It took Alonso nearly a year to find investors for his big idea, a power plant that would light the whole city. However, Alonso never gave up hope that his dream would become a reality.</p>
<h3>The NCDC of Today... and Tomorrow</h3>
<p>NCDC has grown a great deal since its foundation. From our original power plant our company has grown to handle power, water, and phone services for much of the nation. Our plants boast a full retinue of computerized sensors that stream data to our servers so that our techs can monitor and control these systems from the field.</p>
<br />
<p>Soon, we hope to harness the power of the wind and sun by building wind and solar plants across the country to provide not only brighter homes, but smarter, cleaner energy for brighter, cleaner futures.</p>
